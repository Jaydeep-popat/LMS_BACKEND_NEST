# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. JWT Access Strategy Enhancement
- **Problem**: The original JWT strategy didn't verify if the user exists in the database or if they're verified
- **Fix**: Updated `src/auth/strategies/jwt-access.strategy.ts` to:
  - Inject PrismaService to check user existence
  - Verify user is still verified (`isVerified: true`)
  - Return comprehensive user information
  - Throw proper UnauthorizedException with descriptive messages

### 2. JWT Auth Guard Improvement
- **Problem**: Basic guard without proper error handling
- **Fix**: Enhanced `src/auth/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts` to:
  - Provide better error handling in `handleRequest` method
  - Return meaningful error messages

### 3. Module Dependencies
- **Problem**: JWT strategies didn't have access to PrismaService
- **Fix**: Updated `src/auth/auth.module.ts` to:
  - Export JwtAccessStrategy for use in other modules
  - Ensure proper dependency injection

### 4. App Module Structure
- **Problem**: PrismaModule wasn't imported at root level
- **Fix**: Updated `src/app.module.ts` to import PrismaModule first

## How Authentication Works Now:

1. **JWT Token Validation**:
   - Extracts Bearer token from Authorization header
   - Verifies token signature using JWT_ACCESS_SECRET
   - Validates token hasn't expired

2. **User Verification**:
   - Looks up user in database by ID from token
   - Checks if user still exists
   - Verifies user email is verified (`isVerified: true`)

3. **User Object**:
   - Returns complete user object with: `id`, `sub`, `email`, `name`, `role`
   - Available in controllers via `@CurrentUser()` decorator

## Testing Authentication:

### Step 1: Register a User
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Test User",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "role": "MEMBER"
}
```

### Step 2: Verify Email
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/auth/verify-email
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "otp": "1234"
}
```

### Step 3: Login
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

Response will include:
```json
{
  "user": { ... },
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

### Step 4: Get Current User
```bash
GET http://localhost:8000/auth/me
Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>
```

## Common Error Messages:

- **"Invalid token payload"**: Token is malformed or missing user ID
- **"User not found"**: User account was deleted after token was issued
- **"User email not verified"**: User needs to verify their email first
- **"Authentication failed"**: No token provided or token is invalid

## Environment Variables Required:

```bash
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET="your-secret-here"
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="your-refresh-secret-here"
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN="15m"
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN="7d"
```

## What Was Previously Causing "Unauthorized":

1. JWT strategy wasn't checking if user still exists
2. JWT strategy wasn't checking if user is verified
3. Poor error handling in guards
4. Missing dependency injection for database access

The fixes ensure that authentication is more robust and provides clear error messages for debugging.
